                <p class="text-muted">
                    You may return most new, unopened items within 30 days of delivery for a full refund. We also pay
                    the return shipping costs if the return is a result of our error (you received an incorrect or
                    defective item, etc.).
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-primary mb-4 mt-5">2. Refund Process</h2>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    You should expect to receive your refund within four weeks of giving your package to the return
                    shipper, however, in many cases you will receive a refund more quickly. This time period includes
                    the transit time for us to receive your return from the shipper (5 to 10 business days), the time it
                    takes us to process your return once we receive it (3 to 5 business days), and the time it takes
                    your bank to process our refund request (5 to 10 business days).
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-primary mb-4 mt-5">3. Exchanges</h2>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    If you need to exchange an item for a different size or color, please contact our support team. We
                    will guide you through the process to ensure you get the right gear.
                </p>

                <h2 class="text-primary mb-4 mt-5">4. Damaged Items</h2>
                <p class="text-muted">
                    If you receive a damaged product, please report it to us within 48 hours of delivery with
                    photographic evidence. We will arrange for a prompt replacement or refund.
